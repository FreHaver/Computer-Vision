EVALUATION
NB
Make sure the path to matconvnet is specified at the top of the evaluate.m file

To get the accuracies of the models as claimed in the paper run in MATLAB:
> evaluate

To get the tsne visualizations of the models as shown in the paper:
uncomment show_tsnes() in evaluate.m and run:
> evaluate

To get accuracy of other models mentioned in paper, choose options and run:
> get_accuracy_model(option)
Where option can be: 
	      best-model, worst-model (to get models from t-SNE visualizations)
              freezing-40epochs, freezing-80epochs, freezing-120epochs
              augmented-rotation, augmented-noise, augmented-saturation, augmented-none, augmented-combination, augmented-finetunenoise

TRAINING
To train new models, make sure the folder part2/data/cnn_assignment-lenet has no trained networks in it
Run:
> main
To train model with data augmentation go to finetune_cnn.m and set opts.networkType to augmentednn, choose augmentation in opts.augmentation
